# Setup Workflow

## Requirements

This chapter requires you have to know some concepts of Kubernetes:

- [Cluster, User and Context](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/configure-access-multiple-clusters/)
- [Limit Range](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/limit-range/)
- [Resource Quotas](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas/)

## Overview

When you are working with Kubernetes, here is some situations that you want to limit access and quota in your clusters:

- Developers should have full permissions in and only in their **space**
- A cluster that hosts both **testing** and **staging** environment's resources. And you want to limit resources quota of **testing** as minimum as possible. That s no one can create a large application in **testing** environment.

In this chapter, I am going to share with you my experiences about how to set up simple workflow for your team.

## Generate Workflow

### Kubeconfig

Are you curious how you got connected to your cluster when using `kubectl`? Do you remember the file `~/.kube/kubeconfig` in [Chapter 2: Install K3S](./02.install-k3s.md)? That file is the factor helps you authenticate and authorize your request so that you can communicate with your cluster. Here is content of that file

```YAML
apiVersion: v1
kind: Config

current-context: default
preferences: {}

clusters:
  - name: default
    cluster:
      certificate-authority-data: DATA+OMITTED
      server: https://127.0.0.1:6443

users:
  - name: default
    user:
      client-certificate-data: REDACTED
      client-key-data: REDACTED

contexts:
  - name: default
    context:
      cluster: default
      user: default
```

That file defines endpoints you will communicate, users you use to authenticate and sets of contexts you want to work with. As you see, you can define many clusters, contexts and users, as long as you select the `current-context` (you use `default` context, so you use `default` user to connect to `default` cluster)

Acctually, the user in `~/.kube/kubeconfig` is consider as administrator with **FULL** permissions in your cluster. If you lose it, you lose your cluster completely.

### Create resources

The idea is you will create individual `kubeconfig` file for each workflow with different user that have limited permissions. For example, you want to create a `dev-tuannguyen` workflow (`tuannguyen` is my name), you have to create resources bellow in the cluster

- Namespace: chose the namespace that contains your resources. For convenient, I will use the workflow name for namespace name (`dev-tuannguyen`)
- Service Account: This is the user that is used in `kubeconfig`. I will ch0ose the name `dev-tuannguyen-admin`
- Role: Sets of permissions you want to grant to service account above. I will choose the name `dev-tuannguyen-admin`
- RoleBinding: Link the role and the service account together. I will choose the name `dev-tuannguyen-admin`

Here is the complete yaml file content you will use to create them

<details>
  <summary>dev-tuannguyen-resources.yaml</summary>
  
```YAML
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: dev-tuannguyen
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: dev-tuannguyen-admin
  namespace: dev-tuannguyen
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: dev-tuannguyen-admin
  namespace: dev-tuannguyen
  annotations:
    rbac.authorization.kubernetes.io/autoupdate: "true"
rules:
  - apiGroups: ["*"]
    resources: ["*"]
    verbs: ["*"]
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: dev-tuannguyen-admin
  namespace: dev-tuannguyen
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Role
  name: dev-tuannguyen-admin
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: dev-tuannguyen-admin
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: dev-tuannguyen-resource-quota
  namespace: dev-tuannguyen
spec:
  hard:
    requests.cpu: "1"
    requests.memory: 1Gi
    limits.cpu: "2"
    limits.memory: 2Gi
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: LimitRange
metadata:
  name: dev-tuannguyen-limit-range
  namespace: dev-tuannguyen
spec:
  limits:
    - default:
        cpu: 2
        memory: 1Gi
      defaultRequest:
        cpu: 1
        memory: 512Mi
      type: Container
```
</details>

**Note**: As I mentioned, you want to give your developer full permissions in their namespace. If you want to configure another things, please check the official document at [Using RBAC Authorization](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/). By the way, the developer account is also limited by `ResourceQuota` and `LimitRange`.

Create resources is easy by command

```
kubectl apply -f dev-tuannguyen-resources.yaml
```

### Create kubeconfig

Let's create the kubeconfig file at `~/tuannguyen`. For convenient, we will define an environment for that path

```bash
export KUBECONFIG_FILE=~/tuannguyen
```

I also choose the context name and cluster name same as workflow name

```bash
export CLUSTER_NAME=dev-tuannguyen
export CONTEXT_NAME=dev-tuannguyen
```

#### Define cluster

After created resources, you will have the secret resource that contains information of your account, includes access token and certificate authority file.

First, you have to get name of that secret resource by command

```bash
export NAMESPACE=dev-tuannguyen
export SA_NAME=dev-tuannguyen-admin
SECRET_NAME=$(kubectl get sa $SA_NAME -n $NAMESPACE -o jsonpath='{.secrets[*].name}')
```

Second, write out the certificate authority file by command

```bash
kubectl get secret $SECRET_NAME -n $NAMESPACE -o jsonpath='{.data.ca\.crt}' | base64 -d > ./ca.crt
```

Third, define your `CLUSTER_IP`. That should be the same as a server address in your default kubeconfig file. Here is example of mine

```bash
export CLUSTER_IP=192.168.1.4
```

Finally, define the cluster with options `--embed-certs=true`. That allow we embed certificate into kubeconfig, so that it would be stateless and allow you share it with your teammate easier.

```bash
$ kubectl --kubeconfig=$KUBECONFIG_FILE config set-cluster $CLUSTER_NAME \
    --embed-certs=true \
    --server=https://$CLUSTER_IP:6443 \
    --certificate-authority=./ca.crt

Cluster "dev-tuannguyen" set.
```

When you exected that command, `kubectl` will create the kubeconfig file for you and write down the first cluster into that file.

#### Define user

Now, we will get the access token from the secret resource by command

```bash
SA_TOKEN=$(kubectl get secret $SECRET_NAME -n $NAMESPACE -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 -d)
```

Then create the user in kubeconfig file with that token

```bash
$ kubectl --kubeconfig=$KUBECONFIG_FILE config set-credentials $SA_NAME --token=$SA_TOKEN

User "dev-tuannguyen-admin" set.
```

#### Define context

Now, you need to create a context that combines cluster and account together

```bash
kubectl --kubeconfig=$KUBECONFIG_FILE config set-context $CONTEXT_NAME \
    --cluster=$CLUSTER_NAME \
    --user=$SA_NAME \
    --namespace=$NAMESPACE

Context "dev-tuannguyen" created.
```

#### The last step

When you use the `$KUBECONFIG_FILE` above, you want to use the context `$CONTEXT_NAME` by default. Now, execute command bellow to do that

```bash
$ kubectl --kubeconfig=$KUBECONFIG_FILE config use-context $CONTEXT_NAME

Switched to context "dev-tuannguyen".
```

### Usage

To test your your workflow is work well, please execute command bellow

```
$ kubectl --kubeconfig=$KUBECONFIG_FILE get secrets

NAME                               TYPE                                  DATA   AGE
default-token-lpq6d                kubernetes.io/service-account-token   3      5m21s
dev-tuannguyen-admin-token-6nmvz   kubernetes.io/service-account-token   3      5m21s
```

Now, you can share the kubeconfig above to your developer. Then they can use that file to connect to cluster by command

```
kubectl --kubeconfig=/path/to/kubeconfig [flags] [options]
```

Or the can move that file to path `~/.kube/config` and ignore the flag `--kubeconfig`.

## Destroy Workflow

Whenever you want to destroy the workflow (your developer is out :D), you can do it by delete the namespace. Then the `kubeconfig` file of the workflow belong to that namespace will be deactivated immediately.

```bash
kubectl delete ns $NAMESPACE

namespace "dev-tuannguyen" deleted
```

## What's next?

When you want to create a workflow without limited resources, just remove `ResourceQuota` and `LimitRange` section in your resource file. You should only do that in `production` or `staging` environment.
