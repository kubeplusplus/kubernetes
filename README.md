# Kubernetes

> A journey of setup Kubernetes workflows

## Target Audiences

This is a tutorial that is summarized my diary when I configured Kuberntes clusters for my company and my own stack. So, it's required some knowledge to understand contents smoothly.

- Linux environment. Most of steps in this tutorial are performed in Ubuntu 20.04LTS. You have to know how to use it or at least know how to convert commands to other environment like Window or Macintosh.
- [Kubernetes Concepts](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/). It's ridiculous if you want to setup kubernetes without basic understanding, isn't it?
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com) or [containerd](https://containerd.io) knowledge.
